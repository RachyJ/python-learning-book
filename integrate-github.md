# Connecting Gitbook with Github

Gitbook creates a git project for each book. You can store the code in Github and auto sync between Gitbook and Github.

Basic steps:

1. Go to the Settings of your book on Gitbook, and go to Github section. You can choose a Github repository to link your Gitbook. 

2. Clone your book repository so that you can edit the pages on your local machine.

3. When you push your changes to the repository, the page updates will reflect in your G6itbook.
